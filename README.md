# Yet Another Language Server

This is yet another language server for lex/yacc and flex/bison. It is
simply a port of the vscode extension
[yash](https://github.com/babyraging/yash). This is heavily a WIP.

## Features

This LSP server supports basic language features such as:

- [x] Code diagnostic
- [x] Auto-completion
- [x] Hover
- [x] Go to Definition
- [x] Go to Type Definition
- [x] Find references
- [x] Rename Symbol
- [x] Semantic tokens
